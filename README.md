# History
This code was born at the job  ~~free administrator~~ Data Scientist interview ,when solving problems of processing an array of hundreds of numbers on millions of consecutive ones, 
where it was necessary to save the unique ones, and count the repetitive ones and do it as quickly as possible.
Since the "Technical task" was minimal - "Just do it!" 
I wrote a script that uses all the power of the computer for this task ðŸ˜‰
It contains Python, Cython(by wrapper) and C++ (for speed) 
The script itself determines how many threads your computer will pull, 
whether there are graphics cores and enable acceleration, 
making sure that your machine does not explode ðŸ˜„ 
The code doesn't make sense and was created by a fan, BH, 2017
